                      Exactly one year ago today, we had just made it to the summit of Poon Hill after two great days of trekking in Nepal.
                      It was sunrise on a beautifully clear and crisp morning, and both of us stood in awe as we watched the mountains come alive with colour all around us.
                      And if that wasn’t magical enough, it was also the time that Mark chose to get down on one knee and pop the question!
                      It’s hard to believe that it’s actually been that long already (what is it they say about time flying while you’re having fun?!) — and even more so that we’ve never actually shared the full story of what went down here on our blog!
                        </p>
                    <p>
                      We always meant to fill you guys in properly, but the general chaos of life just always seemed to get in the way. Now that these weird times have given us a chance to slow down, the first anniversary of that special day has crept up on us, and we’re starting to get our act together with wedding planning, we figured there was no better time to finally share that story.
                      So without further ado… this is the tale of how we got engaged on a mountain in Nepal!
                      <br>
                      The beginning of our love story is actually less romance and instead, a little bit of chaos and unpredictability.
                      We got chatting, and ended up talking for hours about anything and everything. But if you thought that a lifelong love was born amongst the chaos of pregnancy hormones, crying babies, and stroller test-drives, well, you’d definitely be wrong.
                      See for a range of reasons, the timing just wasn’t right back then. Though we often found ourselves gravitating towards the other and knew deep down there might be something kind of special there, we simply never quite found ourselves on the same page at the same time. Over the next three years, we became close friends instead - though don’t be fooled, it did get a little messy at times!
                      We met more than 10 years ago now, at a pregnancy and babies expo (yes, it still makes us laugh too!) in our hometown, Melbourne. Mark was working at the Nintendo stand designed to keep bored dads occupied which happened to be set up right next to where I stood, handing out flyers for my friend’s photography company next door.
                      <br>
                      That first weekend away led to our first overseas trip together, to Tanzania in 2014, and that first trip together led to us moving in together, planning our big round-the-world trip together, and eventually, throwing caution to the wind and leaving our jobs and Aussie lives behind to travel long-term.
                      Since then, we’ve spent a year backpacking around Asia, Europe and Africa, we’ve found homes in London and Budapest, we’ve built an online business together, explored and eaten our way through more than 45 countries together, and enjoyed doing it all side-by-side.
                      Then, on a balmy summer evening 7 years ago, we finally got our sh*t together and decided to make a go of things for real - and we’ve basically been inseparable ever since! That summer evening led to our first weekend away, to the Grampians about 3 hours from Melbourne (our fave place in Aus!).
