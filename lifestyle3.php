                      @sanskritibrj has been our long time partner in Parsa. Last year we SON X Sanskriti had served warm meals to daily wage workers in Birgunj, Parsa during the lockdown. We have partnered again during this lockdown to provide 200 families in Amarpatti, Jhauwa, Gardaul & Itiyahi village with food parcels containing 3-weeks of supplies. The families supported are mostly Dalit & Muslim. Most of the families working in Birgunj have had no work for a month due to lockdown restrictions. We express our gratitude to @coreintlnepal for their support in this relief drive.‚Å£ <br>
                      We have supported 70 families in Manara Shisawa with food parcels. Manara Shisawa is a remote and secluded village in Mahottari and lies at the border pillars of India and Nepal. This is a Musahar community and they do not own any land. It is not uncommon for border forces to come and violently vandalise their village, displacing them from their homes many times. This devastation is then amplified by their vulnerability to monsoon rains and flooding.‚Å£ We express our gratitude to @nepalrising for their support in this relief drive.‚Å£ <br>
                      We provided 15k NPR to Covid Connect Team who have been instrumental in connecting people and resources by using social media. They are actively working on the ground and making calls and reaching out to people searching for medicines, oxygen, ICU beds and relief.‚Å£
                      We have also supported Ms. Dulari Saday in Siraha whose husband died by because he could not get to hospital for treatment for Covid-19. We are  supporting Ms Saday with 45k NPR in cash and 5k NPR in food items. We are also supporting Mr Saday's father, to ease the financial burden of this sad and distressing time. This is one example of how natural disasters and pandemic affect vulnerable communities more than the others...‚Å£
                      <br>
                      ‚òë Food and hygiene parcels to 80 families (400 people) in Chandrapur Municipality-9, Rautahat‚Å£ <br>
                      ‚òë Food rations to 43 women who sold veggies, corn and fruits on wheels but had lost their incomes due to the lockdown in Kathmandu Valley.‚Å£ <br>
                      A big shout out to all the volunteers who have made this possible. Thank you to our local partners and collaborators. And most importantly thank you, the SON community, for showing up, and yet again showing that together we can make a difference. üôèüèæ‚Å£
