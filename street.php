                        The eleven year old Sonu lives on the streets of Katmandu. His daily routine is a fight to survive in the chaotic capital of Nepal: always on the prowl for food, drugs, charitable tourists and what they seek most – as small boys do anywhere – is fun and adventure.
                        The life of Sonu and his pack is shaped by hunger and violence but is also filled with childlike moments of freedom on the streets

                        STREET LINE – the sequel. Ten years after filming LONELY PACK, we searched and found several of the protagonists. STREET LINE is a portrait of SONU and three other members of the former gang of street children in Kathmandu, Nepal. SONU, then only 11-years old, is now 22 and father of the two years old SONA. We want to accompany him as he strives to cast off the chains of his past, in order to break the cycle of the STREET LINE for the sake of his daughter.

                      <p>
                        STREET LINE - LONELY PACK II is a documentary film about living under poverty, a portrait about love and misery, always in conflict yet with hope for a better future.
                        We accompany SONU at this most important turning point in his life. SONU has lived on the streets since early childhood and is addicted to various substances. As we found him in February 2019, ten years after we first met him, he had been “clean” for two months and determined to beat his addictions and complete the detoxification program. He is homeless and has no perspective of how he can earn a chance for an honest living. Still, he has hope and a motivating reason: He wants to stay clean, to start a new life and, ultimately, take responsibility for his daughter. <br>
                        SONA is 2-years old. She was abandoned at age 4-months by her mother. Since then, she has been under the care of her aunt. She does not understand that SONU is not her uncle, but her father. SONU himself had to grow up without parents. He knows that if he fails to turn his life around, his daughter will face the same fate.
                        We want to tell the full story of SONU and the former LONELY PACK. We want to support SONU, the little SONA, and all the children of the protagonists along their way over the long term! To do this, we need your help!

                        <h3>What is the project goal and who is the project for?</h3>
                        <p>
                          This film is for all people who like honest, authentic, and discreetly personal documentaries.
                          For the past ten years we never stopped thinking about what has become of the street children of that time. That is why we set out once again in search of SONU. The chances of finding him at all were extraordinarily low. Then, to actually learn that he is alive and has a little daughter was very moving. As parents of two girls, we are strongly motivated to help SONU. We are not trained as street workers or social workers.
                          We are filmmakers and what we can do is tell his stories.
                        </p>
                       <h4>Why would you support this project?</h4>
                      <p>
                        We believe in creative and journalistic freedom in the making of documentary films, films that provide an authentic look at what happens at the edges of world affairs. We make films that use time and trust to broaden people’s horizons by revealing in-depth and insightful views of an unfamiliar world. Our approach is to tell a deeply moving story in moving image sequences without the need for commentary. You can provide us the freedom and help us to complete this work as independent film makers.
                        We have often wondered over the years how we could help the LONELY PACK. Unfortunately, we had no answer for the street children back then. However, now with your support, we see a chance to save several of the CHILDREN OF THE LONELY PACK from having to endure the same fate as their parents.
