          The captured pictures are the best captured memories that nothing can win. Time, picture and story are all connected.<br>
          “A picture is worth a thousand words.” That is the motto of a photojournalist. <br>
          It is their objective to produce direct, truthful and bold images that tell the stories for those who have no voice. <br>
          Photojournalists are doing really a great job over the world for humanity, they are working for peace, for human rights, for raising humanity problems and issues, for pointing out the people living below the bottom line of poverty, for raising awareness about educational and child labor issues and much more… Our today’s post is about Inspirational Documentary and Photojournalism Photos. In this post, we showcase 35 powerful, touching and emotional photos that do not just display state of affairs but also tell a story.Since I started teaching, I have observed and preached the benefits of using pictures in the classroom. They are immediate; they stimulate the imagination and promote creativity. Children who often ‘sit back’ are able and willing to contribute. They learn that their opinions matter.
          In fiction writing, authors bring characters to life and create imaginative settings through descriptive writing—using vivid details, figurative language, and sensory information to paint a picture for readers. Well-crafted descriptive writing draws readers into the story. It’s an essential part of storytelling that every author needs to learn.<br><br>
          We express sincere appreciation of the hard work of all photojournalists who are working for humanity, sometimes risking their lives for the sake of their duties and responsibilities. <br>
          This article is a tribute to all of them and their accomplishments and works.<br>
          A picture may be worth a thousand words, but on social media you need a caption.So Let's Share<br>
          Once Upon A Picture is, unashamedly, a passion project. I spend a lot of time looking at illustrations, digital art and animation.<br> I have ‘pinned’ many of pictures and spent hours searching for writing prompts. I have an unhealthy love of picture books.<br>
          It was a natural step to start a blog sharing the best.<br><br>
          All of the work shared here is done so with the permission of the artist. It’s important that children appreciate the person behind the work, and many artists enjoy hearing children’s responses to their creations.<br>
